# Data Management Protocols for Coastal Research
## Preamble
Data on rocky shore environments will be collected by various organisations and individuals. The data in the form of photographs taken along transects on intertidal shores will be collected, uploaded to a server and made available on a website. 

## Data Collection Procedures

Detailed protocol for Quick Biodiversity Assessments conducted at long-term monitoring sites along fixed transects 

1.	Be ready to start at a site 1.5 hours before spring low tide
2.	Locate the bolts that mark each transects and secure the 150 m tape measure to the top-mid-end bolts
3.	Change camera settings: Macro and flash must be ON!!!
4.	At every meter mark, starting from the top bolt and facing the sea, place the 30x30cm quadrat’s left bottom corner at meter interval mark (Figure 3). So the left edge of the quadrat will touch the transect line, and the quadrat will sample the communities to the right of the transect line. If no measuring tape is available, a rope with clear markings at each metre can be used.
5.	Take a photograph of the 30x30 cm quadrat each metre interval along the length of the tape measure. Take photographs as far down the shore as conditions allow. It helps to make sure that the measuring tape/metre mark is visible indicating how far from the starting point the quadrat position is.
6.	Ensure that the entire 30x30 cm PVC frame is in the view finder of the camera – do not zoom in or out with the camera, instead move in closer with your body to ensure that the pvc frame is just inside the view finder.
7.	Make sure that the transect number is also visible on the marker in each photograph (refer to photograph 1b).


## Data Management Description

Standard procedures are described for the ingest, processing storage and access of the images comprising the data.  (Is there a document that already describes standard procedures for digital image data managment? We should cut and paste from that. Maya's commment: NO - I don't have a clue... will need help with this) (We should try to get ready made data capture software for capturing the metadata. 


1. Each photo must be tagged with the time and position (date, time, latitude and longitude from GPS), transect number, position on the transect, data collector name, affiliation, equipment used, exposure settings., by the data producer.  A table should be provided with the complete list of metadata entries required. (How much of the metdata can be automatically included for the images? Cameras with GPS and time stamps?)


2. Photos and metadata are uploaded to the server.

3. Each photo is assigned a UUID. 

4. Each set of photos is assigned a group UUID, and a record created linking individual UUIDs to the group ID. 

5. Metadata tagged with UUIDs are added to catalogue.  
6. Catalog and Data are accessed through a user interface on a server accessing the catalog and database. 

### Registry 

A description of the procedure for registering data producers and equipment is required.

### Catalogue

A description of the catalog and how to access it is required. 

THIS STILL NEEDS REFINEMENT...
